Current version is heavily inspired and basically just an Android app version of [Freemodoro](https://freemodoro.vercel.app/), built with Jetpack Compose. App is now live at [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevinesg.pomodoroapp). Please feel free to try it out! :)
## Roadmap
Aside from implementing Freemodoro's [roadmap](https://github.com/shwwwna/freemodoro), I will add these features and also fix current bugs:
- send notifications when minimized
- dark mode
- improve overall UI/UX; add animation on button click
#
- [FIXED] states getting reset during configuration changes (e.g. screen rotation)
- [FIXED] clicking the back button results into unwanted interactions (e.g. incorrect timers)
- [FIXED] randomly "flickering" timer
- fix app becoming inactive while minimized (timer pauses after a while)
