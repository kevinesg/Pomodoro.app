# Pomodoro
Current version is heavily inspired and basically just an Android app version of [Freemodoro](https://freemodoro.vercel.app/), built with Jetpack Compose.

## Roadmap
Aside from implementing Freemodoro's [roadmap](https://github.com/shwwwna/freemodoro), I will add these features and also fix current bugs:
- improve overall UI/UX
- run in the background (when app is minimized)
- send notifications when minimized
- scale dimensions to screen size instead of fixed dp/sp
- dark mode
- upload to Google Play Store
#
- [FIXED] states getting reset during configuration changes (e.g. screen rotation)
- [FIXED] clicking the back button results into unwanted interactions (e.g. incorrect timers)
- fix randomly "flickering" timer
